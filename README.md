# Project Description

This project allows the user to use Drake's existing rap lyrics with a RNN model to generate new rap lyrics. Existing song lyrics are scraped from Rap Genius using their API, and a RNN model is created using Keras in Python to make the predictions.


# Getting Started

1. Use Genius Scraper.ipynb to scrape existing song lyrics from Genius.com and save it to alllyrics.txt.
2. Run RNN Model.ipynb to open allyrics.txt and preprocess the data to be used. AN RNN model is created using Keras to generate new rap lyrics based on the existing data.


# Troubleshooting

If the .ipynb files do not load on GitHub, please copy each .ipynb GitHub URL directly into:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

* This is a GitHub issue with Jupyter Notebook compatibility
