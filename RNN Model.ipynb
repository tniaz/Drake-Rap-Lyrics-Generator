feel like a woman  baby    ', '    2016 MTV VMAs Vanguard Award Intro for Rihanna    The first time  the first time I met Robyn Fenty was 2005. She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto  the song was  Pon de Replay   and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. It  s hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called  Work.  n nToday the world knows Little X as Director X  they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later  they still know Rihanna as the one and only  Rihanna. n nCaptivating from day one  the iconic being known as Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them that  s often a peak  but for her that was a starting point  as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since. n nWhen it comes to music  she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances  they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself  which is when it gets a little awkward. n nWhat  s most impressive isn  t the endless list of stats  awards and accomplishments. What  s most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success  some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does  which is being herself. n nThis woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados  surrounded by the same friends  speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it  s to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all  we love the woman who hasn  t changed since day one. n nShe  s someone  she  s someone I  ve been in love with since I was 22 years old. She  s one of my... she  s one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I  ve looked up to her even though she  s younger than me. She  s a living  breathing legend in our industry.

from those protectin   the block nNobody lookin   out for nobody nMaybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody nInstead of bein   somebody that makes the news nSo everybody can tweet about it nAnd then they start to R.I.P. about it nAnd four weeks later nobody even speaks about it nDamn  I just had to say my piece about it nOh  you gotta love it but they scared of the truth nSo back to me

nYou rappin   like the throne should be the three of y  all n Best I Ever Had  seems like a decade ago nDecadent flow and I still got a decade to go nOh please  take it ease  where  s the love and the peace nWhy you rappin   like you come from the streets  nI got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees nAnd I  m never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves nPhantom slidin   like the shit just hit a puddle of grease nI cook the beef well done on the double with cheese nSpecial order for anybody that  s comin   for me nShit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze nYou see they got me back talkin   like it  s just 40  Oli  and me nCuttin   all loose ends  I be the barber for free nI  m almost at four minutes going off on the beat nFeel like I  m in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats nMan  oh  you gotta love it nAnd on top of that it  s getting harder to eat nRappers downgrading houses  putting cars on the lease nTo think labels said they had a problem marketing me nAnd now it  s everybody else that  s getting hard to believe nBut man  oh  you gotta love it nAnd head to toe I  m Prada covered nI know your girl well  just not in public nBlame the city  I  m a

Last night when I saw the video of Alton Sterling being killed it left me feeling disheartened  emotional and truly scared. I woke up this morning with a strong need to say something. n nIt s impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and law enforcement remains as strained as it did decades ago. No one begins their life as a hashtag. Yet the trend of being reduced to one continues. n nThis is real and I m concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family  my friends  and any human being that could fall victim to this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I believe things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step. n nMy thoughts and prayers are with the Sterling family and any family that has lost someone to this cycle of violence. n nBe safe out there. More life.

This was not from a clothing brand shoot for my music career. This picture is from 2007  a time in my life where I was an actor and I was working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles  being stereotyped and type cast. The photos represented how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment. Me and my best Friend at the time Mazin Elsadig who is also an Actor from Sudan were attempting to use our voice to bring awareness to the issues we dealt with all the time as black actors at auditions. This was to highlight and raise our frustrations with not always getting a fair chance in the industry  and to make a point that the struggle for black actors had not changed much    ', '    Blem

nNow it  s December  I  m driving  and she  s like  Where  s my hi   nIt  s weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy nSee that was a segue  I believe the matter nIs what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter nWhere the Timb   laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up nDrug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up nWhere girls become exes from Summer  s caught ho  in nThe winter cars come out  the summer cars go in nAnd some places is breezy  and some it start snow ing nAnd if you planning family vacations you better know when nBut some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city nInstead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity nCause mom stays up late  she seen them videos nWhere Cancun college students pouring water on their titties  n n

Verse 2  Drake  nForget to mention  this girl that never gets to the beach nShe lives just West of my street  and so we destined to meet nSince I  m driving  I ask her how to get to the suite nShe doesn  t answer  opens the door and just gets in the seat nShe throws her bag in the back  and starts adjusting the heat nShe  s bold but I roll with it  I  m impressed cause she  s sweet nThen she says  I heard your song and I  m obsessed with the beat nI mean  the lyrics are good  but I  m obsessed with the beat nI love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good nThere  s a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat  nOff this I  m kinda taken back for a second nI get her number she tells me to call her after this session nAnd so I do  and it  s kind of awkward  the surface hard to scratch nUntil we end up sexin   and now my heart attached nI  m thinkin off I should  ve been more Southern nAnd realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin   and ho  n n Drake talking

everyone I  m the prince up in this cold clear town nAnd stupid me I just listen to her nInstead of wondering if this is really gon   last me the whole year round nBut then Spring shows up  and it  s Dallas in this bitch nThe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed nWhen we were together it seeming like way back when nBall players hop on the plane and make it way back in nSee she used

waiting on the breakup nSo we can get back to them cognac nights nWith dress codes and light skinned girls that won  t act right nAnd I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild nThe winter came and blew his cold air through nBack then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her nBy the end of the week I would know that crew nAnd we  d assembled a trio  a whole new scene nWith three ladies in the shot we never broke routine nAt the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin   nWe had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen nBut this Summer is different it  s a two man operation nGranted the fact that we one man short nGot love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation nCause handlin   crack is a one man sport nInstead of dress up  I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin   nI find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin   nThe face  the breast  the bras  the toes nI  m still solo and a long night draws to a close nCause it  s a fact  if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside nWe  ll never talk again  scary and true nThat song Special I recorded with Voyce well it  s like a classified nIt  s what I  m lookin for to carry me through nYet I can  t seem to find it  every girl that possesses it nOnly wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit nAnd when they talk about they past and lovers nAnd you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others nYet you find peace with yourself  now least there  s some room to ride nThere  s also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive n n Voice  nStrolling in the park  and watching winter turn

   ESPYs Conference Call    Connor Shell  n nYou re so vocal about how much you care about your hometown of Toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city. Can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like LeBron to make that decision  and that ultimate responsibility  n nDrake  n nYeah  I mean  I think that for the last week and a half I ve probably been bothering LeBron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be. I think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life he s in. I don t think that there s a better way to deal with it than how he just did. I think if we can give out an award at the ESPYS for incredible essay writing  I would definitely love to present that to him because I think what he just did was patriotic in its own way  was courageous and was just  to me  I think it s going to be one of the most historic things of our generation. n nI m just honored to know him and glad that I ve gotten to  no pun intended  witness this moment for sure. I think it s an incredible thing.  I actually woke up kind of late today  so I m just catching on. It s a great feeling for me. I can t wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud I am because he s been a friend of mine for a long time. n nShell  n nObviously  you ve joined Saturday Night Live and we ve had Justin Timberlake host the show. Are you going to take a more musical approach to the ESPYS than what we ve seen in the past  n nDrake  n nI think obviously one of the talents that I m able to bring to the ESPYS is music  but I m just going to get up there and I want to just prepare a great night for people. I think we have prepared an incredible night for people. I definitely want to incorporate music  but I m not there to put on a strictly music based show. Yeah  we definitely have some incredible pre tapes. Yeah  I think it s just going to be a great night overall. I m there to deliver a great hosting job. n nShell  n nWhat makes the perfect ESPYS host  We ve seen some amazing people like Justin Timberlake and John Hamm and even LeBron James. What strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer  n nDrake  n nWell  I think what makes a perfect ESPYS host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats. But I think most importantly what I bring is the fact that I feel that I know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys I have personal relationships with. I think I m going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that I don t know. n nTo me  it s just about knowing the room that you re in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve. n nShell  n nHosting a sports awards show  what do you feel is music s role in sports  n nDrake  n nWell I said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go. I think that when I speak to any of my friends that play sports they re always super into music  whether it be rap or other genres. My dream in life or my other dream in life that I ll obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league  so I think they re synonymous in that way. We inspire each other  and I think that s what really ties music and sports together. n nShell  n nThis is a question for the producer  and if possible I have a follow up for Drake. With the LeBron news and the decision that was so successful for ESPN  was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the ESPYS  Did anybody reach out  Were you close  n nMaura Mandt  n nNo  there was not an attempt to have that be there. And with the decision  it wasn t something we were looking to have that announcement be on the ESPYS. Certainly if LeBron wanted to announce on the ESPYS  I would have happily had him there. I think what the ESPYS is about is the sports world plays out over the year  and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective  and that s what you look for the host for. n nWe re going to be reflecting on the year  and LeBron is something that happened  so it will definitely be something that we ll address in the show. But just like in sports  we don t try to make that news happen. It unfolds. n nShell  n nDrake  in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance  and a lot of times in hip hop that s kind of also a part of rap music and it s always been. Do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage  whether it be metaphorically or outright in hip hop  n nDrake  n nI think that s a funny question. I think it s a good fit. I definitely think that hip hop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for. I think we re not trying to end people s careers or make people feel bad in any way  and that s kind of most of the time what problems in hip hop are about. So our night  like I said  is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports. n nSo  yeah  I think there is definitely a difference. Though being clever with words is being clever with words  so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has. But I think the end goals are a bit different. n nShell  n nYou re also being aware of public perception. For instance  you Instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer  right  and you so like you definitely have  I don t know how to put it  maybe a love triangle thing going on with Skylar and she ll probably be there. Can we expect a joke or where you ll mention it like you did with SNL when you did the whole dated Rihanna thing  Everyone loved it  so can we expect that now that you ll be hosting the ESPYS  n nDrake  n nWell  I obviously don t want to give away the material. But I do have a growing affection for Skylar  and I m not sure she ll be able to make it  but I m sure I ll give you a treat if you enjoy my past references. I m sure  if I haven t done it already  now that I know you re looking for it  I might stick one in there  for sure. You never know. n nShell  n nOne of the things about ESPN and the ESPYS is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the build up.  Today  I don t know if you realize this  but you ve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that Chris Brown posted up. I just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means  n nDrake  n nWell  as far as the latter end of the question  I d rather not comment on it  but I know that our goal is obviously the night of the ESPYS to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards. I think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet. That s why I m excited. n nWe ve been working hard  like I said  on the pre tapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night  which I can 100  guarantee it will. n nShell  n nIs Cleveland your new favorite sports city  How are you going to incorporate A. Wiggins  Manziel  and LB James into your ESPY segment  n nDrake  n nFirst of all  I d like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks  I do not team jump. I ve been    in the past  I ve always supported the player and not the institution unless it s the Kentucky Wildcats or the Toronto Raptors. Those are two teams that I will never stray from. But what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer  whether it comes to football or obviously basketball  I have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams. n nSo it s not that I m team jumping  I m just a supportive friend. With the recent news  of course I m going to go    of course I m going to go watch games in Cleveland. If not for LeBron  who like I said has been a brother to me for years  I mean  we ve got three kids from Toronto on one team  plus we have Manziel who  again  is part of our family and like a brother. n nSo I definitely have to look into some real estate in Cleveland and maybe make some trips this year. I might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best. n nBut  yeah  like I said  my teams will always forever be who they are  but  yes  I will support the group that has shifted to Cleveland. I think that for Cleveland  a place that I ve been time and time again touring  I just think it s going to be greet. I really would love to see that city grow because they re just a supportive group of people  and it is a great place  so I m really excited. n nShell  n nSo the ESPYS is your second host gig this year. SNL was amazing by the way. So is hosting something that you re trying to do more of or are you just working on more music  You have a lot to write about now that you re a bachelor again. n nDrake  n nWell  actually  my status hasn t changed  just to clear that up. I ve always been out here coasting. But aside from that  the ESPYS is my main focus like SNL. When I commit to something  I don t let my focus stray. n nSo for Maura to give me this opportunity to host  I don t take it lightly. I put everything on hold to be    to give the best performance that I possibly can at this awards show  and then from there  I have things coming up  whether it s the OVO Fest or the tour with Lil Wayne  which is a real thing  which a lot of people don t know if it s a real thing or not  but it s very real and it s going to be very competitive. And then from there  I ll figure out the next steps for me. n nI m always working on new music  but the ESPYS is the main focus right now  and we ll figure out what s next afterwards. n nShell  n nOne thing we learned about you after hosting SNL is you re a tremendous impressionist. I personally loved the Katt Williams and Lil Wayne.  With having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience  can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show  n n nDrake  n nYeah  I m actually excited to say that I definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance  and that is something that I actually pride in that I studied for. I love finding a character and getting into that character  especially if I know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms. So  yes  I will be doing impressions during the ESPYS  and they re good. I m excited.  They re great. n nShell  n nAre you bringing your lint roller  n nDrake  n nOh  yes. I think I ll probably have it somewhere around. Maybe I should. I should bring it out on stage. You shouldn t have said it on the call. You should have anonymously sent that tip in  maybe we would have used the joke. No  I think I ll be lint free that night. I ll have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit. n nShell  n nSo we know that you wore some custom Calvin Klein outfits for your tour. Are you planning on the same fashion wearing any Calvin Klein suits  and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what they re going to wear  n nDrake  n nI m not exactly sure what brands I m going to be wearing. Right now I m sort of still  like I said  very focused on the show. I ll figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers I ll be wearing. But I m more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that I ll be draped in for you all to admire. So that s really what my main focus is  but I ll get my suits together. nI m also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself. I might just cut to somebody and I won t have to say anything. n nShell  n nYou have so many relationships with a lot of athletes. Is there anyone in particular that you haven t met yet that you re looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that you re with already given you any advice about hosting  n nDrake  n nWell  I mean  I ve gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends. You know  one of my mentors who is not an athlete  but obviously Jamie Foxx  a previous host and a big reason why I asked to be a part of this  just because that performance that he gave  I believe he hosted twice or three times  oh  twice  right. It was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music  but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was. So his mentorship and advice has been great to me. Is there anybody that I m looking forward to meeting  nI mean  yeah  I was going to say  I ve never met Skylar. I m sure it will be extremely awkward when I do. But I guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up  which she probably won t. Her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something. But  yeah  if I ever get to meet her I probably owe her an apology right off the bat. It s been all in good spirits. But  yeah  that is the one person I d like to meet. n nJust for that last person  I also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music. I want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down. Yeah  Nick whatever his name is  because he didn t win  so that s how he s going to be remembered. Nick whatever his name is. n nShell  n nCan you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you  and how many are coming from the writing staff  Also  if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song  n nDrake  n nOh  very good double question. Well  for the first part  the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible. We have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady Maura all the way down to the writers and everybody that s involved. Everyone involved has been incredible to work with. We ve been at it now for three months  I think  just on and off  meeting and talking and brain storming. As far as ideas being mine  I am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that I submitted are what I m going to be performing or delivering on Wednesday night. Whether it be music  jokes and pre taped pieces  I was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it. n nIs writing a joke harder than writing a song  I think that because of the way I write songs which is very honest  raw emotion about my life  I think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because it s just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding Drake song as the public would deem it. n nBut  yeah  I mean  all my music is so honest  that sometimes it s hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself. When you re able to be lighthearted and joke around  I enjoy it. It comes a little quicker than songs do. n nMandt  n nI d like to make a comment on the collaboration process. Having worked on the show a number of years  one of the things that really resonates in the content is when it s authentic from the person delivering it. Being able to have the access we ve had to Drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on what s coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life  it really elevates it  so it s definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved. n nWe had a shoot the other day from one of the skits  and on set he was coming up with stuff  and you guys will see it and know what I m talking about when you see the show. But there was no script in certain areas of it. It was really like an improv session  and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see. I m really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show.    ', '    Everywhere I Go     Intro  nHo  nYeah  nIt s Drake  nTrendsetters... nYeah  nI love this man.  Aha.

The tour  slated to start after the Canadian rapper  s OVO Fest  will kick off August 8th in Darien Center  New York and run through September 27th  when it ends in Woodlands  Texas. That tour  which is sponsored by a video game manufacturer  will feature a nightly competition between fans of the two rappers. n n nThe meaning of the album title is unclear  but the announcement is just one part of what will be a busy summer for the rapper. On July 16th  Drake will host ESPN  s ESPY Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles  where the ceremony will be televised live at 9 p.m. EST on the sports channel. The show intends to celebrate the best moments in sports with music  comedy bits and appearances by famous athletes. n nLater in the month  Drake  s label OVO Sound will release two records by artists he signed. Majid Jordan will put out A Place Like This on July 22nd  and PARTYNEXTDOOR will release PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO on the 29th. Drake recently made a guest appearance on the latter artist  s  Recognize   streaming below via Rap Up  which will appear on the album. n nDrake will then stage OVO Fest in Toronto on August 3rd and 4th  when Outkast will perform and he will do his own set  with appearances by yet to be confirmed special guests. This year  OVO Fest was awarded a CAN  300 000 government grant  which amounts to roughly US  268 000  as part of an initiative to help out festivals in Ontario. A press release claims the festival has sold out of the fest  s 35 000 tickets.

everybody happy I think I would need a clone nPlaces we get flown  parties that we  ve thrown nI  ve done more for this city then these rappers that have blown nIt  s only been three years nLook at how I  ve grown nI  m just in my zone nI call this shit the calm nYeah  but I  m the furthest thing from calm nDedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond nEverything will be ok and it won  t even take that long nYou can see it in my face or even read it on my palm nLeader of the new school  it  s proven and it  s known nI  m sittin   in a chair but in the future it  s a throne nI know you like to worry  it  ll be better if you don  t nCause n n Break  n nYou know everything gon   be all right  I promise nI apologize to you know  put y  all in this position vent to y  all but n40 Mama always say don t ask permission nJust ask forgiveness you know so uh  forgive me  yeah  yeah n n Verse 2  nUh nAnd life is so insane nLook what I became trying to make a name nAll my first dates are interrupted by my fame nBecause every picture taken is a fan that you can gain nThey love it when you smile unaware that it  s a strain nIt  s a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain nWomen need attention  therefore  women will complain nDevelop hatred for men and say that you  re the one to blame nTryin   to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game nI just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwyane nIt  s a weight that  s on my chest whoever spotting me is playing nSo I  m lifting all alone try not to get a sprain nHoping Western Union doing currency exchange nCause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed nLike  how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range nAnd he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change nDamn  and I could only feel his pain nCause in Memphis Tennessee there  s only so much to attain nSo I  m filling out the form at the counter once again nHe say he love me I just hope he doesn  t say that shit in vain nI  m why your girl heart is in a slang nCall me  Heartbreak Drake   I  m the hardest one to tame nAs a man  I  m just honest  as an artist I  m a king nWith my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain nYea  and see  this is the thang nWhat they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain nThe shit I write while staring out the window of a plane nIs the single handed reason I remain me n n Outro  nI said I call this shit the calm nBut I m the furthest thing from calm nSwear I m putting on nAnd everybody wanna ask nWhat type of act you putting on  like nMan    ', '    The Grind     Intro  Nickelus

feel like a woman  baby        2016 MTV VMAs Vanguard Award Intro for Rihanna    The first time  the first time I met Robyn Fenty was 2005. She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto  the song was  Pon de Replay   and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. It  s hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called  Work.  n nToday the world knows Little X as Director X  they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later  they still know Rihanna as the one and only  Rihanna. n nCaptivating from day one  the iconic being known as Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them that  s often a peak  but for her that was a starting point  as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since. n nWhen it comes to music  she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances  they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself  which is when it gets a little awkward. n nWhat  s most impressive isn  t the endless list of stats  awards and accomplishments. What  s most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success  some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does  which is being herself. n nThis woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados  surrounded by the same friends  speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it  s to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all  we love the woman who hasn  t changed since day one. n nShe  s someone  she  s someone I  ve been in love with since I was 22 years old. She  s one of my... she  s one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I  ve looked up to her even though she  s younger than me. She  s a living  breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and gentlemen  the recipient of the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award for 2016  Rihanna.        2AM    Stop pretending  I know when you re lying nI know there s someone else taking all your time

know it  ll be January in no time nAnd your absence is very concernin   nIt  s like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin   nShit is purely for sport  I need a 30 for 30 nBanners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey nI got a club in the Raptors arena nChampionships  celebrations durin   regular seasons nPaternity testin   for women that I never slept with nI  m legally obligated if they request it nSo much legal action like I  m Michael Jackson nLuckily  I  m great at avoidin   distraction nUsed to give no reaction  now I  m overreacting nAhh nigga  that shit gotta go platinum nI just listened to Closer to My Dreams nWide eyed and uneducated at 19 nI can  t rap like that  all young and naive nNot after all of the shit I  ve seen and the things I believe nDrastically changin    thank you for all your patience nI  m just in a different space and I choose to embrace it n4 000 square feet just isn  t as spacious nYou loved me back in the basement nGuess it is what we make it nI  m tired of awkward exchanges and niggas   crooked ways nTired of champagne toasts with people that look away nPeyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother nThe season start and I don  t wanna nSee you end up with nothin   nY  all throw the word  family  around too much in discussion nRookie season  I would  ve never thought this was comin   nThey knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden nNow you the one gettin   buckets nThey put their arm around you nNow you becomin   the crutches nKids got on your number cause you the one they look up to nAnd women that you seen on TV look better in person nAnd either they wanna fuck you or convince you nThat they care to see where it goes from there nBut these ain  t the girls from Brampton nThis ain  t that local action nThe haters just bringin   me and my people closer  actually nWhat happened to the things nYou niggas said was supposed to happen  nAre we just supposed to nIgnore the fact that it never happened  nWe just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two  nSupposed to forget your mistakes  but not forget about you  nMy plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf nAnd treat the money like secrets  keep that shit to ourselves nPapi champ   young pablito de seis dios n6 G O D  I think I was destined for this shit nWhen I was   round Keyshia Cole and T.I nAnd Young Dro was poppin   off with  Ain  t I  nWay before niggas had they hands out nLike they doin   macarena nBut  who am I to complain now  I  m still around  they know        4422     Refrain  nI m runnin   but can t run away nYou say you changed nBut you never change up n n Chorus  n44  22 nYou build it up to break it halfway through nJust make the call  22 nBut you re just the same as I ever knew n44

fuckin   game thankless nWe movin   militant but somehow you the one tankin   nNo limit to where I can take it nAnd you know me as a Cris bottle sender  check picker upper nI thought we looked out for one another nSaw us all as brothers in the struggle  too blessed to be humble nI guess it  s different in the city I come from  all the sudden nI got people showing how much they truly resent me nThey whole demeanor just spells envy  they tryna tempt me nThe higher I get  the less they accept me nEven had the OG  s tryna press me  ha ha ha  ha nNo way out   cause I  m already in it nI  m not attending when I do a show and get a ticket nGood business can clean millions  I got the vision nI been had it since  No Scrubs  and No Pigeons nEven back when I wasn  t as poppin   nWhen they told me take an R B nigga on the road nAnd I told   em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky nI tried to make the right choices with the world watching n Mike never tried to rap like Pac  Pac never tried to sing like Mike  nThose my dad  s words to me when I asked him how to make it in life nAnd I always said my mother gave the greatest advice  yeah nLook at me now  they look at me like the golden child nCan  t nobody hold me down  especially not right now nCertain shit is just too wild to reconcile nTake that  take that  no love in they heart nSo they fake that  DiCaprio level the way they play that nDamn  nigga  what is that  nY  all don  t hear no songs  then hit my phone like you did that nAnd you even hit my line like   Where you been at   nIt  s always on some shit like  n When can I get a favor   or  Where my bitch at   nLike I  m about to tell you where she been at nCosta Careyes  I got her kidnapped nShe ain  t sorry and I ain  t sorry  it  s too late for sorry nGreen  White  and Red on my body   cause I  m dipped in Ferrari nAll she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY nShe complain  I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys nMy summer diet is just Ros  and calamari nLook  now you got me started nI  m the black sheep  rest in peace to Chris Farley nI got a lot to lose   cause in every situation I  m the bigger artist Always gotta play it smarter nY  all shook up  I  m here on the cookup nCameras pointing every time I look up nThat  s why I gotta duck behind Chubb  s shoulder nJust to hit the Kush up sponsorship dollars is sky high nHe be like   Drake  will you please stop smoking la la   nChubbs  why try  I  m a thug  I  ma die high nGot the Rose pink tinted lenses  it  s a Wednesday nArchitects takin   dimensions  they redoin   the entrance nYeah  redoin   the

I  m sleep but I  m awake nFor that one night when niggas try and reach inside my safe nDon  t push me   cause I  m way too uneasy nowadays nThese guys move so greezy nowadays nI tell you my life and y  all don  t believe me when I say it nSave my stories for down the line nI  m too ahead of the curve every time nJust Total the hits and see what you find  you SWV n  Cause you weak and I  m always

from those protectin   the block nNobody lookin   out for nobody nMaybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody nInstead of bein   somebody that makes the news nSo everybody can tweet about it nAnd then they start to R.I.P. about it nAnd four weeks later nobody even speaks about it nDamn  I just had to say my piece about it nOh  you gotta love it but they scared of the truth nSo back to me showin   out in public  that  s a hotter subject nI  ve been whippin   Mercedes and nigga try to budget nI gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins nShout out to Ashley  Tasha  Bianca nJulia  Ericka  Southern America nPart of my heritage  pardon my arrogance nPart in my hair again  that  s that comeback flow nComeback flow  once I start it  s apparent nI  m with girl whose ass is

nYou rappin   like the throne should be the three of y  all n Best I Ever Had  seems like a decade ago nDecadent flow and I still got a decade to go nOh please  take it ease  where  s the love and the peace nWhy you rappin   like you come from the streets  nI got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees nAnd I  m never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves nPhantom slidin   like the shit just hit a puddle of grease nI cook the beef well done on the double with cheese nSpecial order for anybody that  s comin   for me nShit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze nYou see they got me back talkin   like it  s just 40  Oli  and me nCuttin   all loose ends  I be the barber for free nI  m almost at four minutes going off on the beat nFeel like I  m in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats nMan  oh  you gotta love it nAnd on top of that it  s getting harder to eat nRappers downgrading houses  putting cars on the lease nTo think labels said they had a problem marketing me nAnd now it  s everybody else that  s getting hard to believe nBut man  oh  you gotta love it nAnd head to toe I  m Prada covered nI know your girl well  just not in public nBlame the city  I  m a product of it nYoung nigga from the city you gotta love it        8AM in London*    Lyrics will be available upon release.

nBetter than her telling me the check  s no good nNow they wanna act like I do no good nFunny   cause I really did more than I should nI made a decision last night that I would die for it nJust to show the city what it takes to be alive for it nCan  t get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it nYou know 40 wants peace but I  m down to cut ties for it nAnd I can  t sleep these days unless I take one nIf they don  t have a story these days  they  ll make one nLife is always on  man  I never get a break from it nDoesn  t matter where I go  I can never get away from it nThey give me loyalty and I don  t gotta pay for it nSame way  breads gotta break for it nKeeping people fed is my only peace of mind now nAnd I turn the six upside down  it  s a nine now nI made a decision last night that I would die for it n n Chorus  n Dying  yeah  yeah  gangstas  gangstas  gangstas...  n Dying  yeah  yeah  gangstas  gangstas  gangstas...  n Dying  yeah  yeah  gangstas  gangstas

One St. Thomas flows nMe  my niggas and some Madonna hoes nThat look just like virgins but trust they down to go nDiscussing life and all our common goals nSmart kids that smoke weed  honor roll nLook how the champagne diamonds glow nFine dining pour another glass when the wine is low nI  m in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling nWhatever it is I got  it  s clearly appealing nThese other rappers getting that inferior feeling nI hope you feel it in your soul  spiritual healing nTake a look at yourself  the mirror  s revealing nIf you ain  t got it  you ain  t got it the theory is brilliant nPeople ask how music is going  I heard it pays nI just came off making two million in 30 days nDamn   I guess it does  is what the message was nSometimes I feel I be spending my money just because nWith Weezy I  m just out here repping us n  til I get to shake the hand of the man that  s blessing us nYeah  I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics nKush got the room smelling like teen spirit nI ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up nUntil I lose  for now I  m the game  s single leader nI fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up nAnd book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up nWho you like  tell me who it is nI  mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list nI should call it a night  but fuck it I can  t resist nThis one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss nWithout a response from me you really fail to exist nAnd I love to see you fail  that feeling there is the shit nI swear  pussy nigga get your bread up nEnjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up nWhy your scary ass looking down  pick ya head up nNo one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get up  nWith nose plugs in now  I can smell the set up nSo you just wasting your time  you only making me better  yeah nI try to tell them don  t judge me because you heard stuff nChase N. Cash that  s my brother from the Surf Club nDamn  that nigga always kept it so hood nBack when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods nAnd have girls fall through like coins in the couch nNow we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about nScared for the first time  everything just clicked nWhat if I don  t really do the numbers they predict  nConsidering the fact that I  m the one that they just picked nTo write a chapter in history  this shit has got me sick nBut if I really do it don  t expect to get a split nCause this truly is some shit I don  t expect for y  all to get nI  m nervous but I  mma kill it cause they   bout to let the realest team in nThrowing up in the huddle nigga  Willie Beamen nBut still throwing touchdown passes nIn tortoise frame glasses  hopin   that someone

Last night when I saw the video of Alton Sterling being killed it left me feeling disheartened  emotional and truly scared. I woke up this morning with a strong need to say something. n nIt s impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and law enforcement remains as strained as it did decades ago. No one begins their life as a hashtag. Yet the trend of being reduced to one continues. n nThis is real and I m concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family  my friends  and any human being that could fall victim to this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I believe things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step. n nMy thoughts and prayers are with the Sterling family and any family that has lost someone to this cycle of violence. n nBe safe out there.

Apology for Autism Line    J.Cole wrote a beautiful and moving apology to individuals and families affected by autism who were understandably hurt by a verse in  Jodeci Freestyle . I share responsibility and offer my sincerest apologies for the pain this has caused. Individuals with autism have brilliant and creative minds  and their gifts should not be disparaged or discounted. This was a learning lesson for both of us  and I m grateful for the opportunity to try to right this wrong. J.

cost  at prices we all could eat off nA real street dog nThe type of nigga that y  all niggas be studying learning how to get street off nWe have an impostor  alert the doctor nBout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka nShock em like Blanka from Street Fighter  heat got a nHurricane kick  murder everything quick nLook  my new Ryu nine is stupendous nWhy do guys choose my crew to pick wit nMy

all day n n Verse 2  Drake  nI  ve been hated by many  wanted by plenty nDisliked by some  but confronted by none nSince they don  t show me sincerity  I load up  lock up nTake shots at em I guess you could call it a parody nAnd compared to D nThey one fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon  dude you a pear to me nIf that  s not how it is it  s how it appear to be nYou got blind heaters  in my sweats is a mind reader nAnd when the psychic get to touching my palm nSeein   your physical  the things that you never say to me visible nEspecially when one of your artists feeling threatened nCause I  m harnessing a weapon  won  t you pardon my reflection nMirror  mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage nAnd play around  to perfection I  m the spitting image nMy verbal camp is vivid  I told you I  m spitting image nIt seems we often want to start but never get to finish nMy verbal campus is Villanova  and those of you feelin Hova nAnd writing college rhymes  but the thrill is over nLet me assist you like a specialist nSo you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this nIt  s not a problem wit X  I guess I  m a pessimist nWhich means if shit goes bad I say   I expected this  nAnd me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate nInstead of understanding its a tune of hate nThe city  s mine like Oklahoma  s a Sooner state nAnd we  re gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late nSo  why don  t you walk up in the spot using less strut nYou ain  t Morris Chestnut  you lighter and less cut nAnd lets be honest  by now you should be your own scholar nYou still a proteg   that  s the reason I don  t holler nYou got rappers being repetitive actors nYou stay ahead of the game  I  m ahead of the practice boy        Asthma Team    I swear to you Lord nSame dudes used to laugh at me nSee me in the CL 6 with Haffa B nThey know that money begets money so naturally nMe and Haffa could blow a couple of stacks hassle free nI m like fuck y all haters on behalf on me nCause I could flood the city with a staff of three nI m talking me and two part  ners in that Caprice nWith no copies made I got the master keys nAnd fast cars  fast women  fast cash and cream nCould mould you rappers like plasticine nI have to dream  but dog nMe and success are two things you don t wanna find your ass between n*Back against the wall like a plasma screens* nThe inside of my wallet is pasture  past your green nAnd you are now hanging with the asthma team nSweetie catch your breath while I smash the scene nI should leave Earth  nothing left to do here nEveryday is Christmas and e ry night is New Year s nSay whatever  I never been concerned about who hears nCall my town Sparta and I m coming with two spears nI m telling you dog  always got the spring collection in fall nI run my bill up making executives calls nAnd with me  women be building these sceptical walls nBut once you slept with one dime man  you slept with them all  uhh nFamily  money  and music is all I ever knew nMy necklace suffer from depression it s forever blue nCheer up baby you don t see all this revenue  nI started the game at level two nI m sayin  nStop acting like teen girls are my only market nI parallel the Flying  Spur   Tony park  it nAnd it s cool if you spill suttin it s only carpet nThat s why I get my interior colour only dark shit nToronto s where you

hang with nI m nervous round my boys  it depends on their anguish nDepends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi nWith dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis nDepends on what they do to achieve that nRobbing r b singers   specially if they know where the keys at n specially if they know where they girl live nGet the info  leave with ya money man  thats how the world is n nThats how niggas puttin they dirt down nStreets are seedy  I call em sesame nIt s Ernie and Bert s town n specially when these young ns get turned down for work opportunities nNext week same place ll get burnt down nCoincidink  not likely not a chance nHow can we be so aware of these problems and not advance  nAt least start put a bid in  its hard just to fit in nA lot of people only play they part when they spittin nBut I don t think that they understood nThey using this darkness for penetration in the hood nI took the ivory way in and yes I m glad that keenan could nNot bad meaning bad  but bad meaning good good good n nNot bad meaning bad  but bad meaning good nNot bad meaning bad  but bad meaning good good good        Bag Jackin Bitches     Hook  nWhat we doing Drake   We bag jackin  bitches

pushin nWatch how just like Republicans I  m behind the bushes n It wasn  t me    if you asked me  that  s what I  mma tell ya nAnd I  mma eat so much chocolate  my blood type  s Nutella nGot wanted signs from madd parents  state troopers nKidnapped Willy Wonka and bitch slapped an Oompa Loompa n n Hook  n n Drake  nGive me your Reese  s Pieces  give me your Hershey bars nI want your Milky Way  give me that Snickers bar nI would Trick or Treat but I  m too old now nSo I snatch your bag so I don  t look like a pedophile nMy sticky fingers got all of these mamas mad at me nWe  re talking stomach aches  restraining orders  cavities nI probably won  t have no teeth when I  m finished nI don  t pay for the porcelains  I just marry my dentist n n Hook         Bar Mitzvah in 1999     Hook  nI m black and Jewish nDon t be so foolish nI m black and Jewish nIt s a Mitzvah n n Verse  nPlease don t forget I m black  please don t forget I m Jewish nI play ball like Lebron and I know what a W 2 is nChilling in Boca Raton with my mensch  Lenny Kravitz nThe only purple drink we sip is purple Manischewitz nAt my show  you won t simply put your hands in the air nWe can also raise a chair or recite a Jewish prayer nLike Baruch Yitadel Yisrael nVe et ha Kim Kardashian Kanye West  amen nI eat Hova with nova  knishes with my bitches nA bagel and cream cheesy with my boy  his name is Weezy nDo not go to Feingold s  though nThe pickles are rubber nAnd I will not be harming ya nI read the Old Testament  okra and matzahball  I ll eat the rest of it nI celebrate Hanukkah  dated Rihannakah nBirth right in Israel  mama from Canada nDaddy from Africa nBest of worlds when you re Jewish with black in ya nChallah         Barry Bonds  Freestyle      Verse  nIt  s what you all been waiting for ain  t it nYour weekly entertainment nFor me to get a hold of this beat and go   head  claim it nI  m about to paint a picture  you niggas go   head  frame it nSince we gettin Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit nI flow far from mediocre nAnd if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker nYou and your whole crew are like a deck of 54 nSo it  s obvious ya  ll gone steady be rollin with some jokers nAnd me I  m rolling with some brokers nLike damn could you niggas get any broker  nI got my new girl so content nJust save yourself the embarrassment  don  t even approach her nDisguise your self  go buy a costume nI am making stock works  while you working stock rooms n ughh  and I was praying I would drop June nBut label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes nSo I keep it rocking for Pete  s sakes nYou fake gangsta rappers a clich  nAnd if you ain  t talking dough when you meet Drake nI  ll be all in your face  like   No speak a la ingles  nSoon as you hear it you quote it nThey try to be the one that I done left out the show with nBut trust me I  m aware  and my cars right there nIs this interior enough for ya  ll ulterior motives nCause if you like it ya  ll should stick with me nMy money good  I ain  t never had to flip a ki nAlotta ice  alotta cream like Dickey Dee nMight cut the phone and disapear like Mishy Me nBut I  mma try and have you on the trip with me nSlid in threw a Henri Bendel like it  s slippery nAnd your ex man is a hater officially nProbably cause he know I  m exactly what you wish he be nYeah that  s the reason why he looking hard nCause I  ve done snatched the chips ahoy out the cookie jar nHe just mad cause his girl  s at the house nWith her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card nLet me address this  pardon me while I fix nA couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix nI guess he thought he could of been Gotti in the flix nBut at this point I  m just poking a body with a stick nNowadays rapping is a children  s hobby nAnd girls keep telling me I  m still this snobby nI tell them myself who I am feeling probably nJust because I got a buzz like a building lobby nIt ain  t a song that your ass finna skipp nI tried to sell weed  give me cash for this zip nThe way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car nSeem like she don  t really need no gas for the trip nMillionaire shades  fade with the waves nI smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids nThat just let  s me know that we ain  t on the same page nAnd that goes out to every nigga except Trey nI  m outta here baby nThey asked me about the past years and how does it phase me nI wouldn  t take it back  naww not if they pay me nMr. betcha that  s expensive cause it  s not a fugazi nSpittin a crock pot of bottemless gravy nThe shit is so nasty  how is it tasty  nAnd you can probably find him walking out of a Macy  s nForget it girl  they just thinking how to replace me nExit with a joke  leave these niggas some hope nYou took that Ye beat and put that shit in a choke nWell I  m thinking I should leave out on this note nNigga keep your two cents I ain  t tryna leave you broke n n Refrain  nLife of a Don  lights keep glowing nCome up in the club with that fresh shit on nAnd something crazy on my arm  uh ahem nAnd here  s another hit  Barry Bonds        Beautiful Music    You can t love  but I bet ya nYo can t hine yeah n n Verse 1  nHere we Gooo nThe 1st time around nI left the cars at the house nAnd I put the diamonds down nThem things come and they go it s bout the rhyme in Now nI m seeing it clearer  the season is nearer nAnd still I must change  I m like a broken bill nConservative for the most but I m out spoken still nThey not sure it ll work but their all hoping nHe ll emerge the victim  my words are pictures nAnd yes the colors so loud that u heard my scripture nWith four walls nGive me the right brush and I draw all nI promise I been thinkin  before ya ll nI barely get tired  I m rarely inspired nAnd you accomplish in a week is What I m daily required nI m meetin  quotas while you rappers having sleep overs nSpending nights in studio try to be Hova nBe in the throne instead of being ya own nBut look n n Hook   nYoung Check your freestyle nI am fast approachin  on the weekend nIt s me  Niko  Bryans here  D10 nFreestyle shit bout to segway to the verse here we go n n Verse 2   nIt s like I m makin  moves in my city though nMy ex girls wanna be up in the video nThey ex girls are steady tryin  to get with me though nImportant and vital nI m caught in a cycle nAnd this is all I know nAnd yes I know it well nI try to explain nAnd my effort comes to no avail nI m from the place where they release records and no one sells nAnd still they claim king nNigga it s the same thing nAll day long nBut that s the screw face nRappers will friend you at first but really they two faced nHoping you trip and slip over your own shoe lace nThat s why I tuck em in not givin  a fuck again nD.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you labels can not nPlay me nI ll never go broke nFuck em I m flashin  the pan nI am a passionate man nPlanted with cash in my hand uhh n n Verse 3   nLook... I got few days left nAnd I m a make use of every single one nUntill every singles done and till every record is sold nAnd till every string is strung nThey tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come nDog... it s always been the same nIt s all love nLike no score in a tennis game nFor the son of Dennis James nOwner of the city downtown on a Friday nStreets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway nI roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up nThey will close down richmond nWith no down shiftin  nHaters will say I m adequate nI think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit n19 years I been pimpin  since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then nSeamless transition I m the new fresh prince gettin  pennies for my thoughts nSo I put my 2 cents in nTop of the mornin  I am dropin  a coin in plus nI m changin  the game you see me swapin  a joint in nThey put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together nFor they buy us out nThey profit from the event nWe handin  fliers out nWe profit from the attempt to hand desires out nBut rich is how we re all endin  up nSo if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up nHolla         Behind Barz  Link Up TV Freestyle      Intro  nYeah  Link Up TV  Behind Barz nBig up man like Rashid  Joey  Tadas  yeah nShoutout Giggs for settin  the ting nSN1  OVO nMm hmm  yeah  look n n

nWanna be free and I wanna let go nWe came around and you showed us the most nI know so much shit that I cannot expose nI keep it inside and I laugh on my own nGot all the tea and I m hottin  it up nI need a shade mansion  a room s not enough nYou re droppin  some shit but that shit was a bust nThey got no direction  they re followin  us nI come from a city that they never touch nYour man is a goofy and he could get rushed nI can t name a rapper or girl that I trust nI dream about turnin  these yutes into dust n n Interlude  nYeah  yeah nBig Scorpion  out now nYeah  look n n Chorus  nYou

nThrowin  up six like man had flu nI got way too big off Views nBack to the basics  I won t lose nThey wanna link when they got no chunes nThey too worried  bout sellin  out shoes nI don t give a fuck about jeans and crep nOr goin  to Milan or goin  to the Met nI just wanna make these songs for the set nI just wanna load that and let that wet nI got so much tings in the stash nFold up anyone  dun that clash nGot no sense like Jizzle and shh nBig and bad like leader and shh nCan t do love  cause they get too attached nPhone get broke and whip get scratched nI ma just take my knots in cash nThey

This was not from a clothing brand shoot for my music career. This picture is from 2007  a time in my life where I was an actor and I was working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles  being stereotyped and type cast. The photos represented how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment. Me and my best Friend at the time Mazin Elsadig who is also an Actor from Sudan were attempting to use our voice to bring awareness to the issues we dealt with all the time as black actors at auditions. This was to highlight and raise our frustrations with not always getting a fair chance in the industry  and to make a point that the struggle for black actors had not changed much        Blem

Canadian nThe same day we say were in the area cruisin   in Toronto nHit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me nA false word like the rappers I know nSat down with a few drinks  located where you can  t see us nA white waitress on standby when we need her nA black Maybach  40 pulled up Jeep nNo doors  all that nigga was missin   was Aaliyah nFelt like the initiation  a reality livin   in the matrix nWe talk casually about the industry nAnd how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin   nThen he said that he was the same age as  myself nAnd it didn  t help   cause it made me even more rude and impatient nSo blame it on Mr. OVOXO nThe reason why I  m breathin   all the vanity I know nThe reason why my best friend said she love me more than life nBut I live a double life and need to let her go nThe reason why the highlight was when he said  nYou belong to the people when you  re outside nSo dig a shovel full of money  full of power  full of pussy nFull of fame

Graham  nYou know  hun  I  m a bit concerned about this negative tone that I  m hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel  as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life  and you  re going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this  because I m confident in you  and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I  m hearing in your tone these days.

she  s like  Where  s my hi   nIt  s weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy nSee that was a segue  I believe the matter nIs what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter nWhere the Timb   laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up nDrug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up nWhere girls become exes from Summer  s caught ho  in nThe winter cars come out  the summer cars go in nAnd some places is breezy  and some it start snow ing nAnd if you planning family vacations you better know when nBut some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city nInstead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity nCause mom stays up late  she seen them videos nWhere Cancun college students pouring water on their titties  n n Drake talking  nYeah man

mention  this girl that never gets to the beach nShe lives just West of my street  and so we destined to meet nSince I  m driving  I ask her how to get to the suite nShe doesn  t answer  opens the door and just gets in the seat nShe throws her bag in the back  and starts adjusting the heat nShe  s bold but I roll with it  I  m impressed cause she  s sweet nThen she says  I heard your song and I  m obsessed with the beat nI mean  the lyrics are good  but I  m obsessed with the beat nI love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good nThere  s a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat  nOff this I  m kinda taken back for a second nI get her number she tells me to call her after this session nAnd so I do  and it  s kind of awkward  the surface hard to scratch nUntil we end up sexin   and now my heart attached nI  m thinkin off I should  ve been more Southern nAnd realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin   and ho  n n Drake talking  nYeah  uh  I told ya  ll I had

clear town nAnd stupid me I just listen to her nInstead of wondering if this is really gon   last me the whole year round nBut then Spring shows up  and it  s Dallas in this bitch nThe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed nWhen we were together it seeming like way back when nBall players hop on the plane and make it way back in nSee she used to play piana  and now she never wait for

Man  but I got something to else to tell ya baby  n n Verse 4  Drake  nI remember them encore PMs  breakfast and the wake up nNow Drake  s committed we waiting on the breakup nSo we can get back to them cognac nights nWith dress codes and light skinned girls that won  t act right nAnd I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild nThe winter came and blew his cold air through nBack then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her nBy the end of the week I would know that crew nAnd we  d assembled a trio  a whole new scene nWith three ladies in the shot we never broke routine nAt the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin   nWe had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen nBut this Summer is different it  s a two man operation nGranted the fact that we one man short nGot love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation nCause handlin   crack is a one man sport nInstead of dress up  I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin   nI find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin   nThe face  the breast  the bras  the toes nI  m still solo and a long night draws to a close nCause it  s a fact  if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside nWe  ll never talk again  scary and true nThat song Special I recorded with Voyce well it  s like a classified nIt  s what I  m lookin for to carry me through nYet I can  t seem to find it  every girl that possesses it nOnly wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit nAnd when they talk about they past and lovers nAnd you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others nYet you find peace with yourself  now least there  s some room to ride nThere  s also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive n n Voice  nStrolling in the park  and watching winter turn to spring nStrolling in the park

ya ribs like some tummy crunches nAll my other girls all up on that subtle shit nThey don  t wanna cut it  they want a rapper to cuddle with nConsequences keep weighin me down nSo whenever she thinks I  m serious  I  m playin around nIt gets deeper and cold ER  the funny thing is nI  m writin this in my head and she asleep on my shoulder like... n n Hook  n n Big Pooh  nLook...we had a lil   thing  a wintertime fling nYou some getback for your man mistreat thing nBut that was then  you know some hush hush nI ain  t never really see a future in us nPlus your man still there  let  s be fair nYou  ll do the same things to me nMy feelings never did go past  some late night smash nI  on  t wanna take the place of he  nLate night  s 85 South on my way to the crib nAnd somebody got a song for me nI already know what you about  cause I been the other man nAnd you NOT gonna trap me witcha silly lil plan nIt  s my bad  shoulda chose a wo man nBut I  m in the mix with this lil   girl playin nI  m sayin  you need to do what you do nI  m NOT tryna take it any further with you  C  MON n n Hook  n n Phonte  nUh...uh...I met her at the bar sippin on Patron nAnd now it  s been three years off and on nCause the same page  we are rarely off and on nCause when I  m in  she out  and when she in  I  m gone  c  mon  nWe lost contact like Bausch   Lomb nBut regained it while she was buildin her house a home nWit this new cat  sayin that he doin her right nIt just proves that  she don  t know what to do wit her life nCause if so  she wouldn  t have to change her strategy nAnd wouldn  t need me to recharge her batteries nOne minute she mad at me  next minute it  s all good nAnd I  m in her body like Gray  s Anatomy nI don  t understand why God sent me to you nAnd I cain  t try to justify that foul shit we do  uh  nAll I know is that each time I  m stickin you nI think to myself   Damn  if only her nigga knew   what  n n Hook         Do What You Do     Chorus  nStance on lean  leg up on the

no play nAnd these labels don t give advances so you get no pay nThem little rims on the ride  Imma let those stay nSo these nosy niggas don t know that I get checks all day n Whats he worth   Fans keep trying to guess it nMy record ain t even finish  they keep trying to press it nBoi 1da and Drake if it s beef I address it nAnd the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit nBoth of the deals  nothin  under a mill nWe know you got it to give and we trying to collect it nLong as I got me some heat through the winter nDrake known as a pro  I ma teach you beginners n Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer nFor features  y all better get me while it s cheaper than dinner n Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl nIf you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send

the verses I m writin   you might wanna learn it nYou hatin  my song but your wife wanna burn it nSo now you at the store for some blank CDs nYou can t see me  for your sake  might wanna return it n Cause  if you bring them discs home to ya girl nShe ll forget you and I ll be the only one she concerned with nTo the people that ignored me before this nThis one is for you as a song re recorded nFunny thing is  you just notice me now nBut I was here along  your vision s just been distorted nI m so throwed  wilin  in this  you ask me what the business is nAnd I ll write a sixteen and record it nThe waiting is over I think music needed nDrake cuttin  his records without gettin  weeded nPeople in the South want it chopped and screwed nI got this dude they expectations I ma exceed it nLike a single with only backgrounds nY all record and when it s done  ya lyrics tend to mislead shit nFinally here I ma star with the timin  nMy swagger is chill  and my flow is reclinin  nThis for anybody that s searchin  for cash nAnd purchasin  fast  you only get the dough when you grindin  nAnd so I grind like I m listening to I Wayne nMy pain  you can experience through the rhymin   boy n n Chorus

and helpin   my enemies eat nKeep gettin   temperature checks nThey know that my head overheats nDon  t know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve nMust  ve had your Infrared wrong  now your head in the beam nY  all are the spittin   image of whatever jealousy breeds nDon t push me when I  m in album mode nYou  re not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes nYou send shots  well

purpose nYou niggas leeches and serpents nI think it  s good that now the teachers are learnin    yeah nYour brother said it was your cousin  then him  then you nSo  you don  t rap what you did  you just rap what you knew nDon  t be ashamed  it  s plenty niggas that do what you do nThere  s no malice in your heart  you  re an approachable dude nMan  you might  ve sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes nBut you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the   80s nI had a microphone of yours  but then the signature faded nI think that pretty much resembles what  s been happenin   lately nPlease

ESPYs Conference Call    Connor Shell  n nYou re so vocal about how much you care about your hometown of Toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city. Can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like LeBron to make that decision  and that ultimate responsibility  n nDrake  n nYeah  I mean  I think that for the last week and a half I ve probably been bothering LeBron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be. I think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life he s in. I don t think that there s a better way to deal with it than how he just did. I think if we can give out an award at the ESPYS for incredible essay writing  I would definitely love to present that to him because I think what he just did was patriotic in its own way  was courageous and was just  to me  I think it s going to be one of the most historic things of our generation. n nI m just honored to know him and glad that I ve gotten to  no pun intended  witness this moment for sure. I think it s an incredible thing.  I actually woke up kind of late today  so I m just catching on. It s a great feeling for me. I can t wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud I am because he s been a friend of mine for a long time. n nShell  n nObviously  you ve joined Saturday Night Live and we ve had Justin Timberlake host the show. Are you going to take a more musical approach to the ESPYS than what we ve seen in the past  n nDrake  n nI think obviously one of the talents that I m able to bring to the ESPYS is music  but I m just going to get up there and I want to just prepare a great night for people. I think we have prepared an incredible night for people. I definitely want to incorporate music  but I m not there to put on a strictly music based show. Yeah  we definitely have some incredible pre tapes. Yeah  I think it s just going to be a great night overall. I m there to deliver a great hosting job. n nShell  n nWhat makes the perfect ESPYS host  We ve seen some amazing people like Justin Timberlake and John Hamm and even LeBron James. What strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer  n nDrake  n nWell  I think what makes a perfect ESPYS host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats. But I think most importantly what I bring is the fact that I feel that I know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys I have personal relationships with. I think I m going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that I don t know. n nTo me  it s just about knowing the room that you re in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve. n nShell  n nHosting a sports awards show  what do you feel is music s role in sports  n nDrake  n nWell I said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go. I think that when I speak to any of my friends that play sports they re always super into music  whether it be rap or other genres. My dream in life or my other dream in life that I ll obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league  so I think they re synonymous in that way. We inspire each other  and I think that s what really ties music and sports together. n nShell  n nThis is a question for the producer  and if possible I have a follow up for Drake. With the LeBron news and the decision that was so successful for ESPN  was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the ESPYS  Did anybody reach out  Were you close  n nMaura Mandt  n nNo  there was not an attempt to have that be there. And with the decision  it wasn t something we were looking to have that announcement be on the ESPYS. Certainly if LeBron wanted to announce on the ESPYS  I would have happily had him there. I think what the ESPYS is about is the sports world plays out over the year  and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective  and that s what you look for the host for. n nWe re going to be reflecting on the year  and LeBron is something that happened  so it will definitely be something that we ll address in the show. But just like in sports  we don t try to make that news happen. It unfolds. n nShell  n nDrake  in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance  and a lot of times in hip hop that s kind of also a part of rap music and it s always been. Do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage  whether it be metaphorically or outright in hip hop  n nDrake  n nI think that s a funny question. I think it s a good fit. I definitely think that hip hop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for. I think we re not trying to end people s careers or make people feel bad in any way  and that s kind of most of the time what problems in hip hop are about. So our night  like I said  is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports. n nSo  yeah  I think there is definitely a difference. Though being clever with words is being clever with words  so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has. But I think the end goals are a bit different. n nShell  n nYou re also being aware of public perception. For instance  you Instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer  right  and you so like you definitely have  I don t know how to put it  maybe a love triangle thing going on with Skylar and she ll probably be there. Can we expect a joke or where you ll mention it like you did with SNL when you did the whole dated Rihanna thing  Everyone loved it  so can we expect that now that you ll be hosting the ESPYS  n nDrake  n nWell  I obviously don t want to give away the material. But I do have a growing affection for Skylar  and I m not sure she ll be able to make it  but I m sure I ll give you a treat if you enjoy my past references. I m sure  if I haven t done it already  now that I know you re looking for it  I might stick one in there  for sure. You never know. n nShell  n nOne of the things about ESPN and the ESPYS is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the build up.  Today  I don t know if you realize this  but you ve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that Chris Brown posted up. I just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means  n nDrake  n nWell  as far as the latter end of the question  I d rather not comment on it  but I know that our goal is obviously the night of the ESPYS to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards. I think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet. That s why I m excited. n nWe ve been working hard  like I said  on the pre tapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night  which I can 100  guarantee it will. n nShell  n nIs Cleveland your new favorite sports city  How are you going to incorporate A. Wiggins  Manziel  and LB James into your ESPY segment  n nDrake  n nFirst of all  I d like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks  I do not team jump. I ve been    in the past  I ve always supported the player and not the institution unless it s the Kentucky Wildcats or the Toronto Raptors. Those are two teams that I will never stray from. But what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer  whether it comes to football or obviously basketball  I have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams. n nSo it s not that I m team jumping  I m just a supportive friend. With the recent news  of course I m going to go    of course I m going to go watch games in Cleveland. If not for LeBron  who like I said has been a brother to me for years  I mean  we ve got three kids from Toronto on one team  plus we have Manziel who  again  is part of our family and like a brother. n nSo I definitely have to look into some real estate in Cleveland and maybe make some trips this year. I might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best. n nBut  yeah  like I said  my teams will always forever be who they are  but  yes  I will support the group that has shifted to Cleveland. I think that for Cleveland  a place that I ve been time and time again touring  I just think it s going to be greet. I really would love to see that city grow because they re just a supportive group of people  and it is a great place  so I m really excited. n nShell  n nSo the ESPYS is your second host gig this year. SNL was amazing by the way. So is hosting something that you re trying to do more of or are you just working on more music  You have a lot to write about now that you re a bachelor again. n nDrake  n nWell  actually  my status hasn t changed  just to clear that up. I ve always been out here coasting. But aside from that  the ESPYS is my main focus like SNL. When I commit to something  I don t let my focus stray. n nSo for Maura to give me this opportunity to host  I don t take it lightly. I put everything on hold to be    to give the best performance that I possibly can at this awards show  and then from there  I have things coming up  whether it s the OVO Fest or the tour with Lil Wayne  which is a real thing  which a lot of people don t know if it s a real thing or not  but it s very real and it s going to be very competitive. And then from there  I ll figure out the next steps for me. n nI m always working on new music  but the ESPYS is the main focus right now  and we ll figure out what s next afterwards. n nShell  n nOne thing we learned about you after hosting SNL is you re a tremendous impressionist. I personally loved the Katt Williams and Lil Wayne.  With having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience  can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show  n n nDrake  n nYeah  I m actually excited to say that I definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance  and that is something that I actually pride in that I studied for. I love finding a character and getting into that character  especially if I know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms. So  yes  I will be doing impressions during the ESPYS  and they re good. I m excited.  They re great. n nShell  n nAre you bringing your lint roller  n nDrake  n nOh  yes. I think I ll probably have it somewhere around. Maybe I should. I should bring it out on stage. You shouldn t have said it on the call. You should have anonymously sent that tip in  maybe we would have used the joke. No  I think I ll be lint free that night. I ll have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit. n nShell  n nSo we know that you wore some custom Calvin Klein outfits for your tour. Are you planning on the same fashion wearing any Calvin Klein suits  and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what they re going to wear  n nDrake  n nI m not exactly sure what brands I m going to be wearing. Right now I m sort of still  like I said  very focused on the show. I ll figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers I ll be wearing. But I m more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that I ll be draped in for you all to admire. So that s really what my main focus is  but I ll get my suits together. nI m also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself. I might just cut to somebody and I won t have to say anything. n nShell  n nYou have so many relationships with a lot of athletes. Is there anyone in particular that you haven t met yet that you re looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that you re with already given you any advice about hosting  n nDrake  n nWell  I mean  I ve gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends. You know  one of my mentors who is not an athlete  but obviously Jamie Foxx  a previous host and a big reason why I asked to be a part of this  just because that performance that he gave  I believe he hosted twice or three times  oh  twice  right. It was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music  but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was. So his mentorship and advice has been great to me. Is there anybody that I m looking forward to meeting  nI mean  yeah  I was going to say  I ve never met Skylar. I m sure it will be extremely awkward when I do. But I guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up  which she probably won t. Her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something. But  yeah  if I ever get to meet her I probably owe her an apology right off the bat. It s been all in good spirits. But  yeah  that is the one person I d like to meet. n nJust for that last person  I also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music. I want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down. Yeah  Nick whatever his name is  because he didn t win  so that s how he s going to be remembered. Nick whatever his name is. n nShell  n nCan you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you  and how many are coming from the writing staff  Also  if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song  n nDrake  n nOh  very good double question. Well  for the first part  the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible. We have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady Maura all the way down to the writers and everybody that s involved. Everyone involved has been incredible to work with. We ve been at it now for three months  I think  just on and off  meeting and talking and brain storming. As far as ideas being mine  I am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that I submitted are what I m going to be performing or delivering on Wednesday night. Whether it be music  jokes and pre taped pieces  I was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it. n nIs writing a joke harder than writing a song  I think that because of the way I write songs which is very honest  raw emotion about my life  I think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because it s just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding Drake song as the public would deem it. n nBut  yeah  I mean  all my music is so honest  that sometimes it s hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself. When you re able to be lighthearted and joke around  I enjoy it. It comes a little quicker than songs do. n nMandt  n nI d like to make a comment on the collaboration process. Having worked on the show a number of years  one of the things that really resonates in the content is when it s authentic from the person delivering it. Being able to have the access we ve had to Drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on what s coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life  it really elevates it  so it s definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved. n nWe had a shoot the other day from one of the skits  and on set he was coming up with stuff  and you guys will see it and know what I m talking about when you see the show. But there was no script in certain areas of it. It was really like an improv session  and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see. I m really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show.        Everywhere I Go     Intro  nHo  nYeah  nIt s Drake  nTrendsetters... nYeah  nI love this man.  Aha.

the OVO set like it always was nA little money on the counter I left for my girl nWith a note I m trying to see the rest of the world nIt all looked so amazing when we were growing up nUsed to sit

no screen settin  nBecause I wanna win games  coach I m through assistin  nThe take over  the break s over  nigga nAnd I m a keep killin  em until the day that Drake s over nThe wait s over  the tape s coming nThey bullshittin  but I m equipped with great plumbing nThe human mentality s so eager to hate something nAnd try to play it off like it ain t jumpin  nAnd it s the predicament that you found Drake in nThey condo that I just purchased is sound vacant nCause I have just been sittin  in this cell nThinkin  what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking nAnd whenever I m flowing on the mic nAside from the d I m throwin  in ya  wife nI treat this one session as if it was my last nAnd I pretend tomorrow is the day I m going in for life        Goodnight and Goodluck    I guess this is goodbye  Goodnight and Goodluck nI m sitting outside man I m right in the truck nBags packed  pack of black and milds lighting them up nI m looking down on these niggas while inviting them up nI d like to know the reasoning behind subliminals nLike who told them to mention me  nI am elevated homie  you are elementary nTelling them you selling dope and never sold a Century Sam nSaying you get denied off your entry exam nYou get flow and you done fo   converse in one verse nAbout you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first nAnd ask Juicy if I Stay Fly nOn the cellphone  and got a ten on the other end like an eight bi nSix two and they tell me you ye  high nThey can t but they try  still get offended if I don t say hi nTo me it s kinda gay if I m saying hi to like eight guys nSo I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies nI do nothing that would offend these cats nBut I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats nLike here  sit on this island man and pen these raps nBust them shots  pretend you trap  do whatever man nLong as you never find your way home I m cool with it nI left you a shovel there  you know what to do with it nI never bust a gun  I m Mister C T V nAt least  I m not Mister Dick Riding C T E nRappers believe me  I m cuttin  records with Jody Breezy nAnd that nigga would even admit that you flowin  Jeezy nSlow your roll this ain t a diss song nThis song  will let you know I m not the one to pick on nWhite with the yellow  the over easy I m a swiss on nOnly got a couple girls that I m willing to kiss on nWith the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on nIf they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on nBut I can t call it  maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate nTwo things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh nAnd I m official  what s officially true nIs callin  names would only be beneficial to you nI just tiring you niggas  ya ll the michelin crew nI know a response is something that you itching to do nAnd YOU  you re smaller to me then a thumb tack nMusic enjoy it  well I m just tryna bring the fun back nBut you making out all these dumb tracks  ya LL sixteens nCause I listen to them and I don t call it come BACK nIt s more like a shame or disgrace nConsidering I m the one that you aim to displace nBut you the one I blame in this case nWithout you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate nYour awkward ass singles  the lamest mixtapes nAnd this is what s making you say you came to get Drake nAnd I m thinking the hood s right for you nThe sun shines on my career it s goodnight for you  uh nI m thinking the hood s right for you nThe sun shines on my career it s goodnight for you  nigga        Good Ones Go  Interlude      Verse 1  nSummer s mine nI swear I said about a hundred times  I m gonna need it back nI wish that you would come and find me nJust to tell me that I haven t changed  girl I needed that from you nI m getting

really a pimp nBut I will tell you this  as far as y  all are concerned nPull out my Santa Claus  and make the holidays burn nYou can call me the Grinch  cause y  all are nothing but Who  s nJust another bunch of phony acts with nothing to prove n n Verse 2  Ken Masters  nNow let the kids play like the rider  s ride nWe spendin   all day  these niggas idolize nThey claim they want fame nigga so we decided nThat we gon make   em some stars until the drama dies nBut they can go back to they holes where they mama lies nOr write more lies about they drugs  guns or homicide nFunny  claim the thug life that they abidin   by nBut run up on   em  then they turn into the silent type  they wanna compromise nMy niggas  we ride or die nAnd roll with them bitches that got they body right nThese niggas ain  t built  ain  t got the body type nTime to break a nigga  s spirit like the amistad  tryna fool the audience nFeel the ambience nStars in your presence  kings of the city are appalled by the peasants nAin  t gotta say names  we can all get a reference nBrains and the info from your broads in the west end nMasters  flowing staggers on bars nNigga stay mad cause his swagger  s on Mars

another nigga  s as a threat tho   nI said you a bitch  I heard a seven man echo nYou saying I hustle  my source for currency coke nThey saying you never moving it and currently broke nAnd you risk doing crack time and hang around black crime nJust so you can have something to say in you rap lines nThey say Drake killed it like young girls at a private school  i did  nDog if I were you  I tell you what I would do nI would cut ties with the cops and just make them fire you nLose the body pack and the velcro you feed the wire through nTell them not to call and that  s even if they require you nCause they the only people recording that wanna hire you  it  s true  nWith what I spend in a weekend I could aquire you nSome of them believe you got money you little liar you nBut  I don  t admire

you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops nThere  s still nothin   they could really do nIt  s too bad reality checks don  t cover the balances due nWhenever it  s time to recoup nYeah  soon as this album drop I  m out of the deal nIn the house playin   D  Angelo   How Does It Feel   nI got a fear of havin   things on my mind when I die nWhat you got  time on your hands or time on your side  nIs there any sense in doin   these songs when I  m high  nIs there more to life than goin   on trips to Dubai  nYachts on the 4th of July  G5 soarin   the skies nIs there more to life than all of these corporate ties nAnd all of these fortunate times nAnd all of these asses that never come in proportionate size  nAm I missin   somethin   that  s more important to find  nLike healin   my

The tour  slated to start after the Canadian rapper  s OVO Fest  will kick off August 8th in Darien Center  New York and run through September 27th  when it ends in Woodlands  Texas. That tour  which is sponsored by a video game manufacturer  will feature a nightly competition between fans of the two rappers. n n nThe meaning of the album title is unclear  but the announcement is just one part of what will be a busy summer for the rapper. On July 16th  Drake will host ESPN  s ESPY Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles  where the ceremony will be televised live at 9 p.m. EST on the sports channel. The show intends to celebrate the best moments in sports with music  comedy bits and appearances by famous athletes. n nLater in the month  Drake  s label OVO Sound will release two records by artists he signed. Majid Jordan will put out A Place Like This on July 22nd  and PARTYNEXTDOOR will release PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO on the 29th. Drake recently made a guest appearance on the latter artist  s  Recognize   streaming below via Rap Up  which will appear on the album. n nDrake will then stage OVO Fest in Toronto on August 3rd and 4th  when Outkast will perform and he will do his own set  with appearances by yet to be confirmed special guests. This year  OVO Fest was awarded a CAN  300 000 government grant  which amounts to roughly US  268 000  as part of an initiative to help out festivals in Ontario. A press release claims the festival has sold out of the fest  s 35 000 tickets.

figures when they tax me nOh well  I guess you lose some and win some nLong as the outcome is income nYou know I want it all and then some nShout out to Asian girls  let the lights dim some nShots

women like Seal  nigga nSlave to the pussy but I  m just playing the field  nigga nAre these people really discussing my career again  nAsking if I  ll be going platinum in a year again  nDon  t I got

there when it  s bedtime nAnd fuck you to the niggas that think it  s their time nYeah  don  t make me take your life apart  boy nYou and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy nOh  you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy  nDon  t make me break your Kevin Hart  boy nYeah  it  s whatever nYou know  feeling good  living better nI think maybe I was numb to it last year nBut you know I feel it now more than ever nMy city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay nSecond album  I  m back paving the way nThe backpackers are back on the bandwagon nLike this was my comeback season back  back in the day nAnd I met your baby moms last night nWe took a picture together  I hope she frames it  nAnd I was drinking at the Palms last night nAnd ended up losing everything that I came with nFeel like I  ve been

you know whether it  s disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio  of course compliments of the company and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you.

bullshit as if it was for you to know nAnd I don  t have the heart nTo give these bitch niggas the cue to go nSo they stick around kicking out feedback nAnd I entertain it as if I need that nI had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that nMy privacy about the only thing I need back but nIt  s hard to think of them polite flows nWhen Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes nAnd Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes nAnd you still make it even when they say your flight closed nEyes hurting from the camera phone light shows nLife was so full  now this shit just being lipo  d nAlways said I  d say it all on the right track nBut in this game you only lose when you fight back nBlack diamond bracelets nShowing you the basics  I can  t live and hold the camera nSomeone gotta tape this nAnd make hits like a bitch that  s married  I ain  t miss n24 hours from greatness  I  m that close nDon  t ever forget the moment you began to doubt nTransitioning from fitting in to standing out nLos Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South nWatchin   Hov  s show  embarrassed to pull my camera out nAnd my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out nSo I park about five houses down nShe say I shouldn  t have it until I have the crown nBut I don  t wanna feel the need to wear disguises around nSo she wonder where my mind is  accounts in the minus nBut yet I  m rolling round the fuckin   city like your highness nGot niggas reactin   without a sinus nCause what I  m working with is timeless nAnd promoters try to get me out to they club nThey say I have fun but I can  t imagine how nCause I just seen my ex girl  standing with my next girl nStanding with the girl that I  m fuckin   right now nAnd shit could get weird unless they all down nAnd so I stay clear  we from a small town nEverybody talks and everybody listen nBut somehow the truth just always comes up missing nI  ve always been something that these labels can  t buy nEspecially if they tryin   to take a piece of my soul nAnd Sylvia be tellin   Tez   Damn  Drake fly  nAnd he just be like   Silly motherfucker  I know nThat was your bad  how could you pass up on   em  nHe just take them records and he gas up on   em nWayne will prolly put a million cash up on   em nSurprised no one ever put your ass up on   em  nOh  they did  Po  at least they tried to nAnd that  s what happens when you spitting what  s inside you nBut slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video nAnd they think they can market you however they decide to nNahh  but 40 told me to do me nAnd don  t listen to anybody that knew me nCause to have known me would mean that there  s a new me nAnd if you think I changed in the slightest  could  ve fooled me nBoy  in my city I  m the 2 3 nDrug dealers live vicariously through me nI quit school and it  s not because I  m lazy nI  m just not the social type and campus life is crazy nUnderstand  I could get money with my eyes closed nLost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo nSo if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll nSell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know nCause they need it much more than I ever will nI got new shit  I  m gettin   better still nLittle niggas put my name in they verses nCause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal nFuture said     Cause this   Ye shit  you better kill  nAnd I think this got this Making of a Legend feel nProblem with these other niggas  they ain  t never real n n Outro  nYeah nThat  s all I can say        Scriptures     Verse 1  nLook  here we go nThe first time around nI left the cars at the house and I put the diamonds down nThem things come and they go its about the rhyming now nIm seeing it clearer the season is nearer nAnd still I must change nIm like a broken bill nConservative for the most but I m outspoken still nThey not sure of the work but they all hoping he ll nEmerge to victor my words are pictures nAnd guess the colours so loud that you heard my scripture nWith 4 walls give me the right brush and I draw all nI promise I ve been thinking before y all nI barely get tired I m rarely inspired nAnd you accomplish in a week what I m daily required nI meet quotas while you rappers having sleep overs nSpending nights in the studio trying to beat Hova nBe in the throne instead of being your own nBut Look n n Verse 2  nI m making moves in my city so nMy ex girls wanna be up in the video nThey ex girls is steady tryin to get with me though nImportant and vital I m caught in a cycle nThis is all I know nAnd yes I know it well nI try to explain it  my effort comes to no avail nI m from the place where they release records and no one sells nAnd still they claim king nigga its the same thing nAll day long nBut thats a screw face nRappers befriend you at first but really they two faced nHoping they slip and trip over your own shoelace nThats why I tuck em in not giving a fuck again nD.R.A. you add a K.E nA couple mill and you labels cannot play me nI never go broke I m far from a flash in the pan nI am a passionate man  plan it with cash in my hand nUh n n Verse 3  nI got few days left nBut I mma make use of every single one until every singles done nUntil every record is sold  and every string is strung nTell me take a breather Drake and everything will come nDog its always been the same nIts all love like no score in a tennis game nFor the son of Dennis James nOwner of the city downtown on a Friday nStreets behind me like I took a picture in the driveway nI roll down strips and hose down whips nThat when turtle wax up they would close down Richmond nWith no down shifting nHaters would say I m adequate nThink I got the type of flow that would make an addict quit n21 years I ve been pimping since being nRepurchased trap music 4 times since then nSeamless transition I m the new fresh prince nGetting pennies for my thoughts nSo I put my two cents in nTop of the morning I am dropping the coin in nPlus I m changing the game nYou hear me swapping the joint in nThey put the fires out and bring the buyers out nAnd try and box us all together before they buy us out nIf they profit from the events we handing flyers out nThen we profit from the attempts to hand desires out nBut rich is how we all ending up nI m at the label in the elevator send them up        Separate LivesVer    Verse  nYeah yeah uh nI m feelin  you  gauranteed that you into me nI got the phantom  the aston  the bent e ley nBut let me tell you where a nigga at mentally nTwo things I don t give a bitch  pay checks and sympathy nHa  but I guess it s just the pimp in me nAll around paid  can t even get a sentence free nSo judge a nigga sweetheart  sentence me nI ain t worried it s gon happen if it s meant to be nAnd if you ever feel the need to step inside nBe a woman about it and know we living seperate lives nTrying to tell you  less feelings mean less goodbyes nThat s some game for your ass  better recognize nBut some cats can t even relate nI ain t a mind reader though  so if you tryna

niggas nI guess a hit doesn t add up to a career for you niggas nI must have been hard to watch  what a year for you niggas nIt s December 31st and we in Miami just meditating nYou got your

Gang nYeah we want it all  half was never the agreement nWho would have thought the route we d chosen nWould ever end up the scenic  nI can relate to kids going straight to the league nWhen they

deep enough to have gone swimming nI think I m spending all my time with the wrong women nI think I ll have a chance at love and knowing me I ll miss it nCause me dedicating my time just isn t realistic nMan  the good girls went silent on me nThey got a boyfriend  or left for college on me nAnd all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now nThat make me wish I had a little less mileage on me nBut do I ever come up in discussion nOver double pump lattes and low fat muffins  nDo I  Or is missing what we had out of the question  nI m probably just the reason that you learned your lesson nI got flows for the Marilyn Monroes nWho was there before it all  I guess that s how it goes nThey hear about your cons  but focus on your pros nAnd love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul nBut those same ones from your area will grow into women nThat are ready to get married at hello nBecause of what they allowed  where are they all now  nI know they re somewhere watching nSo I m trying to make them proud nSearching for the meaning  you ll find it next to me nThey tell me I m the hottest  guess we finally get to see nI m feeling like Nas  who am I to disagree  nThey say the doors will open up nSoon as you find the missing key nThat s probably why I m in this bitch shining nJump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment nI rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded nAnd the bandwagon s full nBut you can try and run behind it  I m sorry nPoolside drinking  Margarita rounds nShout out to my city though I hardly be in town nI m the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown nAnd I know life is just a game nIn which the cards are facing down nI m in a world where things are taken  never given nHow long they choose to love you will never be your decision

Wow  that s how you feel          The Calm     Verse 1  nUh nI  m just so far gone nOctober  s own nPlease leave me alone nDrunk off champagne nScreamin   in the phone nSee my house is not a home nFuck is going on nWhere did we go wrong nWhere do we belong nCaught up in the game and it  s one I can  t postpone nMeanin   if it rains  I  m the one it  s rainin   on nWhen my diamond chain is on  still nothin   set in stone nWomen borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne nAnd tell me don  t forget them and I promise that I won  t nFeelin   so distant from everyone I  ve known nTo make everybody happy I think I would need a clone nPlaces we get flown  parties that we  ve thrown nI  ve done more for this city then these rappers that have blown nIt  s only been three years nLook at how I  ve grown nI  m just in my zone nI call this shit the calm nYeah  but I  m the furthest thing from calm nDedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond nEverything will be ok and it won  t even take that long nYou can see it in my face or even read it on my palm nLeader of the new school  it  s proven and it  s known nI  m sittin   in a chair but in the future it  s a throne nI know you like to worry  it  ll be better if you don  t nCause n n Break  n nYou know everything gon   be all right  I promise nI apologize to you know  put y  all in this position vent to y  all but n40 Mama always say don t ask permission nJust ask forgiveness you know so uh  forgive me  yeah  yeah n n Verse 2  nUh nAnd life is so insane nLook what I became trying to make a name nAll my first dates are interrupted by my fame nBecause every picture taken is a fan that you can gain nThey love it when you smile unaware that it  s a strain nIt  s a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain nWomen need attention  therefore  women will complain nDevelop hatred for men and say that you  re the one to blame nTryin   to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game nI just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwyane nIt  s a weight that  s on my chest whoever spotting me is playing nSo I  m lifting all alone try not to get a sprain nHoping Western Union doing currency exchange nCause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed nLike  how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range nAnd he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change nDamn  and I could only feel his pain nCause in Memphis Tennessee there  s only so much to attain nSo I  m filling out the form at the counter once again nHe say he love me I just hope he doesn  t say that shit in vain nI  m why your girl heart is in a slang nCall me  Heartbreak Drake   I  m the hardest one to tame nAs a man  I  m just honest  as an artist I  m a king nWith my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain nYea  and see  this is the thang nWhat they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain nThe shit I write while staring out the window of a plane nIs the single handed reason I remain me n n Outro  nI said I call this shit the calm nBut I m the furthest thing from calm nSwear I m putting on nAnd everybody wanna ask nWhat type of act you putting on  like nMan        The Grind     Intro  Nickelus F

to the sky nPeer pressure always make me feel lesser than a 10 in they eyes nSo I can only grab my pen and advise nStreet legends and chicks seem to wonder nExaclty who I am nYou know me if you had a job at 16 and under yup nIt s Drake and Saint Nick nTake a whiff of this and faint quick nOff a sample of the flow patient nBut I don t lie to rymers nI strip walls and apply the primer nIf there s it

a certain female rapper I will expose and nFor once I think you should tell yo mouth to get to closing nNo I didn t pen that Freestyle shit nI got a session with Digs so the beef I m gone end that nAnybody else get the piece that I bend back nLet it marinate if you niggas dare to hate        The Language     Verse 1  Drake  nI don  t know why they been lyin   nBut your shit is not that inspirin   nBank account statements just look like nI  m ready for early retirement nFuck any nigga that  s talking that shit just to get a reaction nFuck going platinum  nI looked at my wrist and it  s
